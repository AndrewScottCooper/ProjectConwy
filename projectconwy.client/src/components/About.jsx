                <p>I made this project to review and sharpen my skills, find areas where I can improve. And to create something using a wide
                    array of technologies to solve practical problems. </p>
                <p> I hope you enjoyed this project. If you've read a post I made about a peice of it, or saw the video I made once it was all finished,
                    I want to thank you for taking the time to stop by. And hopefully learned something or got inspired by a feature this project incorperated to 
                work on something yourself as well. If you did feel free to message on LinkedIn with any questions or cool things you have been doing!
